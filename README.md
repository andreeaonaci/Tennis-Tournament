Developed an application that can be used to organize a tennis tournament. The application provides 3 types of user features: for tennis player, for referee and for administrator. A user can register and log in and update its account information. A tennis player can view a tournament registration, can view the tour schedule for matches and can view the score of each tennis match. A referee can visualize its own program, can manage the score of the match he referees and can filter tennis players' lists using specific criteria. The administrator can perform CRUD operations for information related to application users, view the list of all users, save filtered lists with match information in several formats (csv and txt) and can accept or deny a tournament registration for a tennis player (notified via email). This project is also implemented using design patterns and security (the tennis player is not able to view the page where the administrator perform CRUDS and the tennis player X should not be able to view the page for tennis matches of player Y + basic authentication & authorization security rules).
